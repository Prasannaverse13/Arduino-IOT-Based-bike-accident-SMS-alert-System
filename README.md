The Arduino IoT Based Bike Accident SMS Alert System is a project that aims to detect bike accidents and send immediate SMS alerts to designated contacts. This system can help improve safety for bike riders by providing an efficient way to notify emergency contacts in case of an accident.

This repository contains all the necessary code and documentation to set up and configure the Arduino IoT based system.

Features
Real-time bike accident detection
Immediate SMS alerts to emergency contacts
Arduino-based hardware implementation
Customizable emergency contact numbers
Low-cost and easy to implement
Hardware Requirements
To set up the Arduino IoT Based Bike Accident SMS Alert System, you will need the following components:

Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno, Arduino Nano)
Accelerometer sensor module (e.g., MPU-6050)
GSM module (e.g., SIM800L)
SIM card with an active SMS plan
Breadboard and jumper wires
Software Requirements
Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
Arduino libraries: Wire.h, Adafruit_Sensor.h, MPU6050.h, and GSM.h
SIM card with an active SMS plan and phone number

Usage
The Arduino IoT Based Bike Accident SMS Alert System will start monitoring the bike's movement using the accelerometer sensor. In case of a sudden change in acceleration, indicating a possible accident, the system will send an SMS alert to the configured emergency contact number.

Ensure that the SIM card is inserted into the GSM module and that it has an active SMS plan. The system should have access to a mobile network to send SMS alerts successfully.
